    "Have you ever worked with target encoders? Did you ever use any tree-based model? If you have worked with either there will likely be a time in which you are tempted to use both in the same pipeline for classifying data points with categorical features. DON'T! At least until you have read this article detailing one dangerous caveat that this combination has.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will guide you through the caveats that appear when a pipeline combines certain members of the family of target encoders with tree-based models and extremely low or high entropy features. I'll clue you in: data leakeages and overfitting issues will break your pipeline's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion will be centered around the most basic target encoder and the leave-one-out encoder and their interaction with tree-based models under certain conditions. Ultimately, it will lead towards a justification to use CatBoost under these same conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that these problems that we will see are easy to solve - just use CatBoost and let it handle the encoding methodology for you. As I will be arguing the encoder that it uses by default for categorical features magnificently handles categorical fetures with both extremely low and high entropies and is still in the realm of target encoding.\n",

    "which shows a perfect fit on the training set even though we know that since the feature and the target are independent this tree would then yield poor results for newly sampled data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not just drop the feature and use others in the data set? I mean: Shouldn't this feature be dropped on the EDA part of the project? Well the answer is that this example is exagerating the presence of the category and consequently its impact. Nevertheless, this impact still happens for milder instances of this same scenario. For instance, if we have that a feature has for 80% of the training data the same categorical value which is uninformative about the target variable, then this phenomenon will happen but only affect this 80% of the dataset. However, if it turns out that for the rest of the dataset the same happens for another feature, then we are doomed to failure as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this would not happen for other encoders. Nevertheless all projects are unique and their particularities may also yield other encoders useless. Hence, it is good to know that we can still use this kind of encoders (we will show it in the future). Additionally, even though it is highly not recommended you might not have information about all the possible features that you can have in the training data but you may still want to use as much information as you can while delegating the triage of useless and usefull features to your encoder + classifier pipeline. Again, although this can happen I would not recommend it since you may incur in unexpected errors. "
