    "Have you ever worked with target encoders? Did you ever use any tree-based model? If you have worked with either there will likely be a time in which you are tempted to use both in the same pipeline for classifying data points with categorical features. DON'T! At least until you have read this article detailing one dangerous caveat that this combination has.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will guide you through the caveats that appear when a pipeline combines certain members of the family of target encoders with tree-based models and extremely low or high entropy features. I'll clue you in: data leakeages and overfitting issues will break your pipeline's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that these problems that we will see are easy to solve - just use CatBoost and let it handle the encoding methodology for you. As I will be arguing the encoder that it uses by default for categorical features magnificently handles categorical fetures with both extremely low and high entropies and is still in the realm of target encoding.\n"
